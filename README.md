In my this project, i've made 2 Player Number Guessing Game.
Here are all the functionalities i've added it up in this. 

1) It's a 2 player game where it'll always be Player1's first turn and immediatly after 1st player guess the correct number, it'll be Player2's turn. When 2nd player's turn end, it'll be 1st player's turn again.

2) This loop will continue until any of the player type 'stop' in input. This is the one of the two ways to stop the game.

3) I've added limit to guessing the Number. It'll display how many tries thee player has left after guessing the number wrong. If it exceeds the limit of tries, the game will conclude. That's another way the game could end.

4) At the end of the game, it'll show the final score of both players and how many total guesses they have made in all rounds.

5) The player with less number of guesses will win. 

Good Luck Whoever Plays This.
Please Let Me Know If There Are Any Bugs Or If I Can Improve My Code Even More.
